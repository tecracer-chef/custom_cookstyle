# custom_cookstyle

## Summary

Placeholder Gem for Chef custom Cookstyle rules.

## Intention

This gem does not contain any functionality, but is intended
to be overridden by internally-served gems of the same name.

Just deploy your own cookstyle rule packages as `custom_cookstyle`
on an internal RubyGems repository and be safe of naming and
versioning conflicts as it will never hit a version 0.1.0 or higher.
